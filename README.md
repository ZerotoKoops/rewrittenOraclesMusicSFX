README
======
There will not be any extra information on how any of the underlying code works as it is all detailed in [custom channel data repository](https://github.com/ZerotoKoops/custom-channelData "custom channel data repository").
Make sure to read the README there as it will detail the steps necessary to use the files here.

Structure
---
There are two folders in the root:
 1. oracleMUS/
 2. oracleSFX/
Inside, there should each be four folders.
 1. Ages/
 2. Common/
 3. Seasons/
 4. unfinished/
The first three are locations of finished rewrites that anyone is free to use.
The content of those folders typically house 3-4 files:
 1. Original S file [.s]
 2. Rewritten S file [-2.s]
 3. MuseScore file [.mscz]
 4. Music file [.mp3]
The only important file is the second, as that is what will replace the original channel data.
The other 3 are useful for understanding of the music, but are not necessary for the transfer process. Again, visit the custom-channelData repository to get full detail on how to transfer.

In addition, if you are comfortable with its use, there is an EXCEL file that houses certain data about each sound as well as hyperlinks to each folder and file.
(Caution: there will be a warning when attempting to open the files. Read carefully and proceed. If you are not comfortable with that, you can just use the folder hyperlink. Moreover, the MuseScore hyperlinks are broken because of something to do with EXCEL. Disregard this as the files themselves still work.)

The fourth folder, unfinished/, should be ignored for obvious reasons.
However, if you wish to only see the original S files, there is another repository that exists for this purpose: [oraclesMusicSFX](https://github.com/ZerotoKoops/oraclesMusicSFX "oraclesMusicSFX").
